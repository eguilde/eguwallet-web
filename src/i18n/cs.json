      {
        "q": "Is my personal data secure?",
        "a": "Yes. EguWallet uses SD-JWT and mDoc/ISO 18013-5 for selective disclosure — you only transmit data you explicitly approve. No presentation is stored. Legal basis: GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) and Regulation (EU) 2024/1183."

      {
        "q": "How does selective disclosure work?",
        "a": "When a service requests identity verification, your wallet shows you exactly what data is being requested. You approve or reject each field. For example, for age-18 verification, the merchant receives only a YES/NO — they never see your name, national ID number or address."
