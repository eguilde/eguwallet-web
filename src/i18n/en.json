      {
        "q": "What is EguWallet?",
        "a": "EguWallet is a European eIDAS 2.0 certified digital wallet developed by IT Eguilde SRL. It allows you to store and present digital identity documents (ID card, passport, driving licence etc.) securely on your phone, with full control over your personal data."
      },
      {
        "q": "What documents can I store in EguWallet?",
        "a": "Currently: identity card (PID), passport and driving licence. Coming soon: vehicle registration, RCA insurance, ITP/RAR, company documents and property documents."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my personal data secure?",
        "a": "Yes. EguWallet uses SD-JWT and mDoc/ISO 18013-5 for selective disclosure — you only transmit data you explicitly approve. No presentation is stored. Legal basis: GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) and Regulation (EU) 2024/1183."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where can I use EguWallet?",
        "a": "Today: Ilfov County Council digital services (ilfov.net) and Sector 2 City Hall (sector2.eu). Expansion to other public institutions and private retailers in Romania and the EU is ongoing."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is eIDAS 2.0?",
        "a": "eIDAS 2.0 is Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 amending the original eIDAS regulation. It guarantees every European citizen the right to a free digital wallet (EUDI Wallet), recognised across all 27 member states."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does selective disclosure work?",
        "a": "When a service requests identity verification, your wallet shows you exactly what data is being requested. You approve or reject each field. For example, for age-18 verification, the merchant receives only a YES/NO — they never see your name, national ID number or address."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is EguWallet free?",
        "a": "Yes, free for citizens during the current pilot phase. EguWallet is undergoing formal eIDAS 2.0 certification — once certified, pricing for institutional integrations may apply, but the citizen wallet app will remain free."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is EguWallet fully certified?",
        "a": "EguWallet is currently undergoing formal eIDAS 2.0 certification by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body (CAB). Until certification is complete, it operates as a pilot EUDI Wallet. All technical standards (ARF 2.5+, OpenID4VCI, OpenID4VP, SD-JWT, ISO 18013-5) are already implemented."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I activate my digital wallet?",
        "a": "Download the app from Google Play, verify your phone number, create a PIN, then connect to your county or city portal to register your documents. The process takes approximately 5 minutes."
