        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Data We Collect</h2>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">3.1 Account Registration Data</h3>
        <p>During wallet registration we collect:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Phone number</strong> — for SMS verification during registration</li>
          <li><strong>Email address</strong> — for email verification during registration</li>
          <li><strong>First name, last name</strong> — for identity association with your wallet instance</li>
          <li><strong>Selfie photo</strong> — for liveness verification and identity matching (processed on-device, transmitted to our server only during PID issuance)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">3.2 Device Information</h3>
        <p>To ensure the security and integrity of your digital wallet, we collect:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Device identifier</strong> (Android ID) — a pseudonymous identifier used to bind the wallet to your device</li>
          <li><strong>Device model and manufacturer</strong> — to assess hardware security capabilities</li>
          <li><strong>Android OS version and security patch level</strong> — to verify device meets eIDAS 2.0 security requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Hardware security capabilities</strong> — availability of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), StrongBox, and biometric sensors</li>
          <li><strong>Biometric enrollment status</strong> — whether fingerprint or face authentication is configured (we never access biometric data itself)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">3.3 Camera (android.permission.CAMERA)</h3>
        <p>The App requires camera access for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>QR code scanning</strong> — to read credential offers and verification requests from relying parties</li>
          <li><strong>Identity document scanning</strong> — to capture your national ID card or passport for Person Identification Data (PID) issuance</li>
          <li><strong>Selfie and liveness verification</strong> — to confirm you are a real person by detecting face orientation and movement (multi-pose check)</li>
          <li><strong>MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) reading</strong> — to extract data from your identity document using on-device text recognition</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>On-device processing:</strong> All camera images are processed locally on your device using Google ML Kit. Face detection, selfie segmentation, text recognition, and barcode scanning models run entirely on-device. Raw camera images are not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly initiate PID issuance, in which case only the document image and selfie are transmitted over an encrypted connection.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">3.4 Bluetooth (BLE) and NFC</h3>
        <p>The App uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Near Field Communication (NFC) for <strong>offline credential presentation</strong> per the ISO 18013-5 standard:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>BLE</strong> — used for proximity data transfer when presenting credentials (e.g., mobile driving licence, digital ID) to a verifier device in person</li>
          <li><strong>NFC</strong> — used for device engagement handshake (tap your phone to a verifier terminal to initiate presentation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">BLE and NFC are only activated when you explicitly choose to present a credential in proximity mode. No location data is derived from Bluetooth or NFC. No data is shared with third parties through these channels — communication is end-to-end encrypted between your device and the verifier.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">3.5 Digital Credentials</h3>
        <p>Your digital identity credentials (PID, mobile driving licence, qualified electronic attestations) are stored encrypted in the Android hardware-backed keystore (TEE/StrongBox) on your device. We do not have access to the contents of your credentials. During presentation, only the specific data fields you explicitly approve are shared with the verifier through selective disclosure.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">3.6 Push Notifications</h3>
        <p>The App uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver push notifications about:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Credential issuance status (when your PID or other credential is ready)</li>
          <li>Verification requests from relying parties</li>
          <li>Wallet attestation renewal reminders</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">We store a FCM device token on our server to deliver these notifications. You can disable notifications at any time through your Android system settings.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Registration:</strong> phone number and email are used solely for identity verification during wallet setup</li>
          <li><strong>Wallet attestation:</strong> device information is used to assess whether your device meets eIDAS 2.0 security requirements (Level of Assurance High)</li>
          <li><strong>Credential issuance:</strong> your identity data (name, document scan, selfie) is transmitted to the PID Provider to issue your digital identity credential</li>
          <li><strong>Credential presentation:</strong> when you present credentials to a verifier, only the fields you approve are shared (selective disclosure)</li>
          <li><strong>Device integrity:</strong> Play Integrity API results are used to verify the App has not been tampered with and the device is genuine</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> eIDAS 2.0 mandatory audit records are maintained without storing personal data in logs</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> FCM tokens are used to send you relevant wallet notifications</li>
        </ul>
